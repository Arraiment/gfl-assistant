# GFL Assistant
Scraper to obtain analyses for dolls in the game Girls Frontline.

Currently scrapes 3 websites:
 1. [GFL Corner's Doll Analytics](https://www.gflanalysis.com/wiki/Main_Page) 
 2. [Angry Trap Midget's Guide to why your waifu sucks](https://gfl.matsuda.tips/dolls/)
 3. [GamePress's GFL Wiki](https://gamepress.gg/girlsfrontline/)

Built with node.js and express.js, repo serves as documentation and version tracking.

Will probably find somewhere to host in the future.
